# Welcome to this Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Project Classic sample (2020.12.29)

Welcome to this sample proyect, here you will find a step by step guide where I have shared my experience with this framework from the very beginning. It's like a "getting started" guide but personalized from my perspective. It's made using the classic framework instead the "Alloy" one. It will be shown in another demo repository soon.

## Pc setup

I needed the next requisites:

- Java 8 64bit 
- Define the environment 
    - variable JAVA_HOME reaching C:/Program Files/jdk1.8.0_271
    - variable ANDROID_HOME reaching C:\Users\my-user\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
- Add to PATH this %JAVA_HOME%\bin
- Enable virtualization, on BIOS and Windows Settings: Hyper-V
- Define Android SDK route within Appcelerator Studio: Preferences/Platforms/Android/General/Android SDK Home
- OPTIONAL: install emulator Genymotion
- If there are no accepted licenses, just type this on a terminal: `%ANDROID_HOME%/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses`
